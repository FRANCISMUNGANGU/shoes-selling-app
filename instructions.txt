Independent Project.

For this weekâ€™s independent project you will be required to create a full CRUD application with its HTML views ,
saving the data in an embedded sqlite database.

The project is a product listing catalog web app with the following specifications :

The web app sells shoes , the products should be displayed in a row with a flex wrap with the following details :
name of shoe :  saved as a text in the database, image of shoe : saved as an image url in the database , and the
price of the shoe.
The above details should be fetched from the database and also have seed / dummy data representation for at least
 2 shoes.
The page should also have a form to add the shoes , with the fields name of shoe , image url of the shoe and price of
 the shoe. Also a link to edit a shoe item and delete the item.
All stylings should be done in bootstrap but the flex or grid container in use can be based off CSS.
